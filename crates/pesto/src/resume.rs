//! Upload resume: persist already-posted segments so an interrupted run can
//! continue without re-sending articles the server already accepted.
//!
//! State is stored as a JSON file (`.pesto-state`) beside the `.nzb` output.
//! Each record maps a `(relative_file_name, part_number)` pair to the
//! `Message-ID` (and wire size) issued when the segment was originally
//! posted, plus whether STAT 223 confirmed it. On resume, `prepare_ready`
//! either skips the segment, re-STATs the stored id without a second POST,
//! or POSTs a fresh article — see [`resume_action`].
//!
//! Trusting a state file blindly is unsafe (see GitHub issue #18): the same
//! output name can be reused for an unrelated or edited file, or with
//! different posting parameters (`--article-size`, `--obfuscate`,
//! `--compress`, `--par2`, `--file-counter`) that change how the input is
//! chunked and named.
//! [`RunFingerprint`] and [`FileFingerprint`] guard against exactly that —
//! a run-level mismatch discards the whole state, a per-file mismatch
//! discards only that file's segments.
