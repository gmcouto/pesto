const ABOUT: &str = "Fast, lean Usenet poster: yEnc-encode files, post over NNTP, emit an .nzb.";

/// Extended description shown by `pesto --help`.
const LONG_ABOUT: &str = "\
pesto posts files to Usenet. It yEnc-encodes each file, uploads the articles
over parallel NNTP connections and writes an .nzb describing what was posted.

A PATH argument may be a directory: it is walked recursively and the whole
tree is posted as one upload, with the folder structure preserved in the .nzb
and PAR2 metadata.

Server and credentials are read from a TOML config file. If --config is not
given, pesto loads it from the OS-standard location: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pesto/config.toml
(or, failing that, ~/.config/pesto/config.toml) on Linux/macOS, or
%APPDATA%\\pesto\\config.toml on Windows — NOT ~/.config, which the Windows
build never checks. Create that file interactively with `pesto --config`,
which prints the exact path it wrote to.

Any config value can be overridden by the matching flag below.

Ctrl-C or SIGTERM once stops gracefully; press it again to abort immediately.
Progress is saved for --resume in either case.";

EXAMPLES:
  pesto movie.mkv                 post one file using the saved config
  pesto ./Season01/               post a whole directory, structure preserved
  pesto --config                  create the config file with a guided wizard
  pesto --out up.nzb a.bin b.bin  post two files and write an .nzb
  pesto --par2 15 movie.mkv       post with 15% PAR2 recovery data
  pesto --dry-run movie.mkv       encode only, never touch the network
  pesto --each ./Season01/        post each episode as a separate upload
  pesto --season ./Season01/      post each episode + a combined season NZB
  pesto --each --jobs 4 ./shows/  post up to 4 entries in parallel
  pesto --watch ./incoming/       watch a folder and post new entries
  pesto --each --ext mkv ./shows/ post only .mkv per episode, skip .srt/etc.
  pesto --cleanup movie.mkv       delete source after successful upload
  pesto --cleanup-to ./archive/   move sources to ./archive/ after upload
  pesto --watch ./in/ --cleanup   watch and auto-delete after upload

By default pesto posts under a freshly generated random identity. Set
[posting].from (or --from) only if you need a fixed one.";
