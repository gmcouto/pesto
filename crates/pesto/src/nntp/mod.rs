//! NNTP client: TLS connection, authentication and the `POST` command.
//!
//! A [`Connection`] wraps a single NNTP session. It speaks just enough of the
//! protocol (RFC 3977 / RFC 4643) to authenticate and post articles — that is
//! the whole MVP surface.
//!
//! Module map: `protocol` owns dot-stuffing and response framing, `response`
//! classifies server replies and error hints, `auth` handles AUTHINFO and
//! proxy checks, `tls` builds the shared rustls client, and `pool` manages
//! connection reuse and checkout.
