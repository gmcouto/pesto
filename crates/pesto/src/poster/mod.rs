//! Parallel posting: the orchestration that ties together file reading, yEnc
//! encoding, article assembly and the NNTP client.

//! Files are read sequentially by a producer. yEnc runs on a small encode
//! pool (nyuu: one encoder filling a ready-article queue). NNTP workers only
//! POST. If PAR2 recovery exceeds a memory limit, the producer re-reads.
//!
//! Module map: `orchestrator` runs the lifecycle; `prepare` and `pipeline`
//! perform its preparation and startup/join stages; `producer`, `worker` and
//! `task` move files through encoding and POST; `connections`, `identity`,
//! `result` and `check` own their named policies; `par2/` plans recovery sets.
