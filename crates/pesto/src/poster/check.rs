//! Streaming STAT check.
//!
//! Every article that gets a clean `240` is queued for a STAT check a few
//! seconds later (`config.check_delay_secs`) — while the upload keeps
//! posting on its own connections, using a small dedicated pool instead.
//! A miss triggers a repost under a fresh Message-ID (the same rationale as
//! the old `repost_missing_segments`: a server that already cursed the sent
//! ID in its dedup history must not be retried under that same ID) and the
//! fresh copy is re-queued for another check. This mirrors `nyuu`'s default
//! check queue (`check.delay`, `check.tries`, `check.postRetries` in its
//! `config.js`) instead of pesto's old model of a single STAT sweep run only
//! after the whole upload finished.
//!
//! A miss doesn't always wait through the full patient retry sequence
//! first, though — see `should_fast_repost`. Once a run has enough
//! first-time checks to trust its miss rate, an isolated miss (rare
//! against an otherwise clean run) skips straight to a repost instead of
//! waiting out `STAT_RETRY_DELAY_SECS` × `check_retries` to reach an
//! already-foregone verdict. A high miss rate — which looks like the
//! server falling behind on indexing rather than individual articles being
//! lost — keeps the patient behavior, so a systemic problem doesn't get
//! answered by flooding an already-struggling server with reposts.
//!
//! Module map: this facade owns the streaming queue and coordinator;
//! `repost` owns article reconstruction plus POST error classification, while
//! `recovery` owns the bounded final recovery pass.
