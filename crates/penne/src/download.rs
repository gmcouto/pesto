//! Draining a [`DownloadQueue`] against configured servers.
//!
//! Fetches each queued segment's article body and decodes it with
//! `pesto::yenc::decode_part` (Phase 3), trying servers in priority order
//! per segment — so a primary provider missing, or serving a truncated copy
//! of, a handful of articles doesn't fail a file a backup server has intact.
//!
//! **Per-segment streaming assembly (`ROADMAP.md` Phase 16):** each
//! decoded segment is written to its file's temp file
//! ([`crate::assemble::StreamingAssembly`]) the instant it's decoded, not
//! once every segment for that file has arrived. Phase 14 already moved
//! assembly from "wait for the whole queue" to "wait for one file's
//! segments"; for a release that's a single large file (a multi-GB video
//! split into thousands of segments, fetched in parallel), that was no
//! improvement — every decoded segment still piled up in memory until that
//! one file's last segment landed. Now nothing is held beyond one
//! in-flight segment's bytes per worker: [`DecodedPart`] is written and
//! dropped immediately, and only a few bytes of bookkeeping (its own
//! CRC-32 and length) survive until the file's last segment triggers
//! [`crate::assemble::StreamingAssembly::finish`]. `outcome.segments` is
//! now just the *set* of Message-IDs that were fetched (not their decoded
//! bytes) — see [`DownloadOutcome::segments`]'s own doc comment.
//!
//! **Concurrency (`ROADMAP.md` Phase 2's long-standing open item, closed in
//! Phase 9):** each server is drained by up to `server.connections` workers
//! running at once — real throughput, not one segment at a time. Priority
//! *tiers* (`ROADMAP.md` Phase 15's `level`+`group` item —
//! [`crate::config::ServerTier`]) are still tried strictly in order (every
//! member of tier 1 finishes its pass before tier 2 starts), since "missing
//! from this tier" is an expected, per-segment condition for a downloader,
//! not a failure to rotate away from the way `pesto::nntp::pool` does for
//! posting — a backup tier only gets asked about the segments the primary
//! didn't have. *Within* a tier, every member server's connections are
//! drained together as one combined worker pool sharing a single queue —
//! that's what pooling two equal-priority servers actually buys over
//! giving them each their own tier.
//!
//! Two resilience mechanisms live here (`ROADMAP.md` Phase 8):
//! - **Cache-first fetch:** before any network request, [`crate::cache`] is
//!   checked for a body already fetched in a previous, interrupted run of
//!   this same download. A cache hit skips the network entirely.
//! - **Retry with backoff:** a connection or fetch error against one server
//!   is retried up to `retries` times (each server's own `retry_delay`
//!   governs the pause) before moving on to the next configured server — a
//!   transient hiccup shouldn't immediately write off a server that
//!   otherwise has the article.
