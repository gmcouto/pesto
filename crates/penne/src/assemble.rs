//! File assembly: turning decoded segment bodies back into whole files.
//!
//! [`StreamingAssembly`] writes each segment to its temp file the instant
//! it's decoded — not once every segment for the file has arrived — so a
//! large single-file release (a multi-GB video split into thousands of
//! segments, fetched in parallel) never needs to hold more than one
//! segment's decoded bytes in memory at a time. Segments are written at
//! their own byte offset (`DecodedPart::begin`) rather than appended in
//! fetch order, so the file assembles correctly regardless of which order
//! they actually arrived in — necessary once downloading is parallelized
//! (Phase 2's still-open N-connection item).
//!
//! The whole-file CRC-32 can't be accumulated by feeding bytes into a
//! running hasher as they're written, the way a single-pass batch assembler
//! would, since segments can arrive in any order. Instead, each segment's
//! *own* CRC-32 and length are kept (a few bytes per segment, not its
//! data), and [`pesto::yenc::crc32_combine`] folds them together in
//! ascending part order once every segment has landed — producing the
//! exact same result as hashing the concatenated bytes directly (that
//! identity is what `crc32_combine` is defined to guarantee, and is
//! verified empirically in `pesto::yenc`'s own tests), without ever
//! re-reading the file or holding its bytes beyond one segment at a time.
//!
//! Writes go to a temporary sibling path first, renamed into place only
//! once every segment has landed, so a killed download never leaves behind
//! a file that looks complete but isn't — and a file missing any segment
//! is never renamed into place at all, `Incomplete`'s temp file simply
//! discarded.
