//! Repairability estimate: compares how much data is missing/damaged after
//! a fetch against how much PAR2 recovery data is actually available, so a
//! release that already looks unrepairable can be flagged before paying for
//! a full [`pesto::par2::verify::verify`] pass (a whole-file re-hash —
//! Phase 13 of `ROADMAP.md` measured this at several seconds even in
//! `--release` for a large file, longer in a debug build).
//!
//! Originally scoped (see `ROADMAP.md` Phase 15) as a check *before* any
//! download starts, mirroring `nzbget`'s `QueueCoordinator::CheckHealth`.
//! Not feasible in that form: [`pesto::par2::recovery_set::RecoverySet::load_metadata`]
//! needs the `.par2` index and its recovery volumes already sitting on
//! disk to know how much recovery data exists at all, and nothing is on
//! disk before a download begins. `nzbget`'s own version has the identical
//! constraint — `CheckHealth` is called per-completed-article as a download
//! *progresses*, never as a pre-flight step, for exactly this reason. This
//! runs the same comparison once the fetch phase has completed (so PAR2
//! data, if the release shipped any, already exists on disk), as a cheap
//! gate in front of the expensive verify pass rather than a replacement
//! for it — see [`HealthCheck::looks_repairable`]'s doc comment for why
//! this is only ever used to *warn*, never to skip `verify_and_repair`
//! outright.
