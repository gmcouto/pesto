# Penne

**Fast NZB downloader for Usenet, written in Rust.**

Companion to [`pesto`](../pesto) (which posts) and
[`parmesan`](../parmesan) (which handles PAR2). Reads a `.nzb`, fetches its
articles over parallel NNTP connections, reassembles the original files,
verifies/repairs them with PAR2, extracts any `.rar`/`.7z`/`.zip` it finds,
and — if asked — cleans up the compressed volumes and PAR2 recovery data
afterward. `--mode` picks how far down that pipeline a run goes; see
[Processing modes](#processing-modes) below.

> **Status:** the core pipeline is complete and tested end-to-end — fetch,
> yEnc decode, assembly, PAR2 verify/repair, archive extraction, resume, and
> retry/backoff, all with real N-connection concurrency per server. See
> [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for what's still open (mainly packaging/release
> and a couple of documented performance follow-ups) and for the full
> phase-by-phase history.

## Quick start

```bash
# Create the config interactively (see Configuration below).
cargo run --bin penne -- --config

# Download, assemble, PAR2-verify/repair, and extract.
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb
```

`penne download` fetches every file the `.nzb` lists, assembles them,
verifies/repairs with PAR2 if recovery data was included, and extracts any
archive it finds — printing a per-file status line for each step. It exits
non-zero if anything is still incomplete or damaged once PAR2 has had its
chance to fix it.

```bash
# Check if articles are present on your configured servers without downloading
cargo run --bin penne -- check path/to/release.nzb

# You can also check multiple releases at once (they will share the connection pool)
cargo run --bin penne -- check path/to/release1.nzb path/to/release2.nzb

# Only need a pass/fail answer? Stop after the first confirmed missing article.
cargo run --bin penne -- check path/to/release.nzb --fail-fast --quiet
```

`penne check` verifies if every article is still present on the configured servers without downloading the bodies or writing anything to disk. It's a high-performance availability check that can pipeline hundreds of STAT commands at once, emitting JSON if asked (`--json`) and exiting with meaningful codes (0 = all present, 1 = confirmed missing, 2 = fatal error, 3 = inconclusive). It natively supports checking multiple `.nzb` files sequentially while reusing the same active connection pool, avoiding reconnection overhead. See [`check`: dedicated availability-check subcommand](#check-dedicated-availability-check-subcommand) below for every flag and the full `--json` schema.

Run `penne --help` to see the configuration, availability-check, and download
workflows together. `penne check --help` and `penne help check` are equivalent
ways to see availability-check-specific options and examples.

A confirmed-missing article (a server returned a definitive `430`/`423`/`420`) is reported separately from an unreachable one (every tried server failed to connect or timed out before ever answering) — `missing` vs `unreachable` in the JSON output, `conclusive: false` when any segment falls in the latter bucket. This distinction matters for callers that act on a check's result (e.g. deciding whether to declare a release dead): a transient network hiccup must never be read as confirmed data loss.

## Configuration

Server credentials live in a TOML file. `penne --config` (no value) launches
a guided wizard that writes one for you at the default location; skip
straight to a manual example below if you'd rather write it by hand.

### Default location

When `--config <FILE>` isn't given, `penne` loads (and the wizard writes to)
the OS-standard path:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Linux/macOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/penne/config.toml`, falling back to `~/.config/penne/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\penne\config.toml` |

If nothing exists there, `penne download` fails with a clear message telling
you to run `penne --config` or pass `--config <FILE>` explicitly — it never
silently proceeds with no servers.

### `--config` forms

```bash
penne --config              # interactive wizard; writes to the default path above
penne download FILE.nzb     # loads the default path automatically
penne download FILE.nzb --config custom.toml   # loads a specific file instead
```

`--config` is a global flag — it works before or after the subcommand.

### File format

```toml
# Where completed, assembled files are written. Overridden by --out-dir.
download_dir = "/downloads"

# Optional: default `connections` for any [[servers]] entry below that
# doesn't set its own. Falls back to 8 if omitted entirely.
connections = 8

# Optional: retry attempts per segment against one server before moving on
# to the next configured server. Default: 3.
retries = 3

# Optional: default processing mode for `penne download` when --mode isn't
# given on the command line (--mode always overrides this per run). One of:
#   "download" - fetch and assemble only; no PAR2 verify/repair, no extraction
#   "repair"   - download, plus PAR2 verify/repair when recovery data is present
#   "unpack"   - repair, plus extracting any .rar/.7z/.zip found (built-in default)
#   "delete"   - unpack, plus deleting the compressed volumes and PAR2 recovery
#                data once extraction succeeds, leaving only the release's other files
# See Processing modes below for the full picture. Default: "unpack".
mode = "unpack"

[[servers]]
host = "news.example.com"
# port = 563          # 563 = TLS, 119 = plaintext. Default: 563 if ssl, else 119.
ssl = true
username = "user"
password = "pass"
connections = 8        # Parallel NNTP connections to this server.
retry_delay = 1         # Seconds between retry attempts. Default: 1.

# A second [[servers]] entry is a backup provider: only asked about
# segments the first one didn't have, never raced against it.
[[servers]]
host = "backup.example.com"
ssl = true
username = "user2"
password = "pass2"
connections = 4
```

At least one `[[servers]]` entry is required. Servers are tried strictly in
the order they're listed — the first is primary, the rest are backup
providers consulted only for segments the primary didn't have. This is the
same `[[servers]]` shape `pesto` uses (see the root
[`config.example.toml`](../../config.example.toml)) minus posting-only
fields, so a combined config file can share the block between the two tools
if you use both.

**Pooling equal-priority servers with `group`:** two *adjacent*
`[[servers]]` entries sharing the same `group` value are drained together
as one combined worker pool instead of one strictly finishing before the
next starts — for two equal-priority accounts (e.g. two blocks of
connections on the same provider, or two mirror providers) that should
share load rather than act as primary/backup:

```toml
[[servers]]
host = "account-a.example.com"
group = 1
connections = 10

[[servers]]
host = "account-b.example.com"
group = 1
connections = 10

# Not in group 1, and not adjacent to it either way: its own tier, tried
# only once both pooled servers above have been asked.
[[servers]]
host = "backup.example.com"
```

Omit `group` (the default) to keep a server as its own solitary priority
tier — unaffected, and how every `[[servers]]` entry behaves without this
field. Servers sharing a `group` value that *aren't* adjacent in the file
each get their own tier instead of being pooled — list group members next
to each other.

**Naming a server for `--server`:** give any `[[servers]]` entry a `name` to
pick it out for a single run instead of drawing on every configured server:

```toml
[[servers]]
name = "blocknews"
host = "usnews.blocknews.net"
ssl = true
username = "user"
password = "pass"

[[servers]]
name = "newshosting"
host = "news.newshosting.com"
ssl = true
username = "user2"
password = "pass2"
```

```bash
# Use only the "blocknews" entry for this run.
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb --stat --server blocknews

# Repeat --server to pick more than one; they keep their relative order
# from the config file (so failover/group semantics are unaffected).
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb --server blocknews --server newshosting
```

Omitting `--server` uses every configured server, exactly as before this
flag existed. Requesting a name that no entry has errors out immediately,
listing the names that do exist.

**Keeping an account out of the automatic mix with `explicit_only`:** an
entry with `explicit_only = true` is skipped whenever `--server` is
omitted, and only ever used when named directly. For a block/quota account
that must never be drawn on as a silent fallback:

```toml
[[servers]]
name = "blocknews"
host = "usnews.blocknews.net"
ssl = true
username = "user"
password = "pass"
explicit_only = true
```

```bash
# Plain `penne download`/`--stat` never touches "blocknews" — only "main"
# (or whatever other non-explicit_only servers are configured) is used.
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb --stat

# Only this run uses it, because it's named explicitly.
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb --stat --server blocknews
```

`explicit_only` requires `name` — otherwise there'd be no way to ever
select the entry, and `penne` refuses to load the config.

## Usage

```bash
# Parse a .nzb and print file/segment/size counts — no network I/O.
cargo run --bin penne -- info path/to/release.nzb

# Download, assemble, deobfuscate, PAR2-verify/repair, and extract.
# --out-dir defaults to the config's download_dir; --password overrides
# the .nzb's own embedded password (for archive extraction and encrypted yEnc).
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb \
    --out-dir ./downloads \
    --password hunter2

# Just check whether every segment is still on the server — no download,
# no disk writes. Exits non-zero if anything is missing.
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb --stat
```

### What `download` does, in order

1. **Fetch** every segment the `.nzb` lists, with up to `connections`
   parallel connections per server. A segment already cached from a
   previous, interrupted run is never re-fetched (see Resume below).
2. **Decode** each fetched article body (yEnc) and cache the raw bytes for
   resume. For encrypted releases (`<meta type="yenc_encrypted">true</meta>`),
   Penne restores FF1-encrypted control lines and authenticates/decrypts the
   body via XChaCha20-Poly1305 before assembly. Unauthenticated segments fail
   closed with zero plaintext committed.
3. **Assemble** each file from its decoded segments. A file missing any
   segment is left unwritten entirely — a partial file that looks complete
   is worse than none.
4. **De-obfuscate**: obfuscated releases (common for scene/P2P posts) hide
   real filenames behind random hashes, in both the `.nzb` subject and the
   downloaded file names. `penne` content-sniffs for PAR2 packets regardless
   of extension, tags them `.par2`, and matches every other file against the
   PAR2 recovery set's real names by size + hash. Whatever PAR2 doesn't
   cover (or when there's no PAR2 at all) gets a best-effort guess from
   archive magic bytes (`.rar`/`.7z`/`.zip`) plus `.nzb` file order — clearly
   reported as a guess, distinct from a PAR2-confirmed recovery.
5. **PAR2 verify/repair** (`--mode repair` or higher), if any `.par2` file
   is present among the downloaded files (including ones just tagged in
   step 4): files left unwritten in step 3 can be recreated *whole* from
   recovery data; files with a bad checksum are patched at just the
   damaged parts.
6. **Extract** (`--mode unpack` or higher, the default) any
   `.rar`/`.7z`/`.zip` found (including multi-volume sets), using
   `--password` if given, else the `.nzb`'s own embedded password.
7. **Clean up** (`--mode delete` only): once extraction succeeds, delete
   every compressed volume and `.par2` file, leaving only the release's
   other files (the extracted media, subtitles, `.nfo`, etc.).

At `--mode repair` or higher, anything still incomplete or damaged after
step 5 makes `penne download` exit non-zero and report which files. Below
that (`--mode download`), a missing/damaged file only prints a warning —
the run still succeeds, and the resume cache (see below) is kept instead
of cleared, so a later `--mode repair` run can pick up without refetching.

### Processing modes

`--mode` picks how far down the pipeline above a run goes, mirroring
`sabnzbd`'s per-category Download/+Repair/+Unpack/+Delete processing
levels — each mode does everything the previous one does, plus one more
step:

| `--mode`   | Fetch/assemble | PAR2 verify/repair | Extract | Delete archives + PAR2 |
|------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `download` | ✓ |    |    |    |
| `repair`   | ✓ | ✓  |    |    |
| `unpack` (default) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |    |
| `delete`   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

```bash
# Just fetch and assemble — no PAR2, no extraction.
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb --mode download

# Fetch, verify/repair, and once everything's intact, drop the archives
# and PAR2 recovery data, keeping only the release's actual content.
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/release.nzb --mode delete
```

Precedence: `--mode` on the command line wins when given; otherwise the
config file's `mode` (see File format above) is used; if neither is set,
`penne` falls back to `unpack`, unchanged from before this config field
existed. Set `mode` in the config file once to change your everyday
default (e.g. to `download` if you routinely handle PAR2/extraction with
other tools) without typing `--mode` on every run.

### `--stat`: check availability without downloading

`penne download <nzb> --stat[=<stat|head|body>]` runs only a completeness
check against the configured server(s), without fetching, decoding,
writing, or extracting anything, and exits non-zero if anything is
missing — useful to script ahead of a real download (e.g. skip a release
that's already expired off the indexer's server). Three methods, from
cheapest-but-least-trustworthy to most expensive-but-certain:

- **`stat`** (the default — `--stat` alone means this): `STAT` (RFC 3977
  §6.2.4), a bare existence check against the server's *index*. By far the
  cheapest, but the index can drift out of sync with what the server can
  actually deliver — seen in the wild: a provider reporting 99.99% present
  via `STAT`, then failing to download a single byte of the same release.
- **`head`**: `HEAD` (RFC 3977 §6.2.2) — still cheap (a few hundred bytes
  per article, not the full body), and on most servers reads from the same
  underlying article storage `BODY` does, so it usually catches the drift
  described above. Not guaranteed, though: some providers apparently serve
  `HEAD` from a more complete path than `BODY` (observed in the wild — a
  provider where `head` still reported 100% present for a release whose
  `body` check, and real downloads, failed completely). Still a reasonable
  default upgrade over plain `stat`, just not a substitute for `body` when
  you need certainty.
- **`body`**: a full, real `BODY` fetch, discarded immediately (never
  decoded, written, or cached) — maximum certainty, the same real bandwidth
  cost as an actual download of the same segments. Pair with `--sample`
  (below) to keep that cost bounded on a large release. Only `stat`
  pipelines several requests per round trip; `head`/`body` don't (pipelining
  buys the most when a round trip carries almost no payload, which stops
  being true once real bytes are involved).

#### `--sample <N>`: check a subset instead of every segment

Only meaningful alongside `--stat` (errors otherwise — a real download
always fetches every segment). Limits the check to `N` segment(s) of *each
file*, spread evenly across it, instead of the whole release — most valuable with
`--stat=body`, whose per-segment cost is a real article fetch, so checking
a large release that way in full often isn't worth it. `--sample 1` (one
segment per file) is usually enough to catch a systemic problem — a
provider that can't actually deliver bodies tends to fail *every* segment,
not a scattered few — while keeping the check's bandwidth down to roughly
`file count` articles instead of `segment count`.

Deliberately **not** implemented as a partial/truncated `BODY` read
(requesting an article and disconnecting before reading its response) —
that would be cheaper still, but abandoning a connection mid-transfer is
the kind of pattern real providers' anti-abuse systems watch for, and it
forces a reconnect (fresh TCP+TLS+auth) for every single present segment.
`--sample` stays entirely inside normal protocol behavior — every request
gets read to completion and every connection closes cleanly — while still
cutting the checked segment count by orders of magnitude on a typical
multi-hundred-segment-per-file release.

A live progress bar (segments checked, not bytes/speed — `stat`/`head`
never fetch a body) tracks the check on an interactive terminal, same as
`download`'s own panel. A concise summary closes the run, leading with the
percentage of articles actually present — the number that matters most at
a glance — plus how many bytes the check itself used, honestly reflecting
each method's real cost:

```
checking 6968 segment(s) across 24 file(s) via STAT...
  complete: movie.mkv (200/200 segments)
  ...

summary
  articles present: 6968/6968 (100.0%)
  files complete:   24/24
  data used:        218.7 KiB (STAT only — no article data downloaded)
```

### `check`: dedicated availability-check subcommand

`download --stat` (above) checks a single `.nzb` inline before deciding
whether to download it. `penne check <nzb>...` is the standalone equivalent
for scripting: it checks one or more `.nzb` files against your configured
servers — same three methods (`stat`/`head`/`body`), same `--sample` — but
additionally supports **multiple `.nzb` files in one run** (sharing the same
connection pool, so no per-file reconnect cost), **structured JSON output**,
**meaningful exit codes**, and checking each configured server
**independently** instead of only as failover backups.

```bash
penne check path/to/release.nzb
penne check release1.nzb release2.nzb --method head
penne check release.nzb --json --quiet > result.jsonl
penne check *.nzb --fail-fast --quiet
```

#### `--fail-fast`: stop once a release is known to be incomplete

By default, `penne check` completes every requested segment so its summary
can give an exact availability percentage and a complete missing-article
list. Add `--fail-fast` when the only useful answer is “is at least one
article definitely gone?”:

```bash
# Exit 0 when every checked NZB is complete; exit 1 as soon as an NZB is
# conclusively known to be incomplete.
penne check *.nzb --fail-fast --quiet

# Same policy, but verify actual article delivery rather than a provider's
# STAT index. This consumes article bandwidth for requests already started.
penne check release.nzb --method body --fail-fast
```

It applies equally to `stat`, `head`, and `body`. It never treats a `430`
from a primary as final while a configured failover server could still have
the article: every applicable server is tried first. Once an article is
confirmed absent everywhere, no new work is scheduled. `STAT` requests
already pipelined are read to completion; an in-flight `HEAD` or `BODY` is
also completed normally, so no NNTP response is abandoned mid-stream.

The result is intentionally **partial**: `stopped_early: true` and a
non-zero `skipped` count mean the unchecked articles are neither “missing”
nor “unreachable”, and `complete`/`conclusive` are both `false`. Use the
default mode when you need a percentage, a complete missing list, or a
provider comparison with `--independent-servers`.

Flags:

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--method <stat\|head\|body>` | `stat` | Which NNTP command to check with — see the method descriptions under `--stat` above; same trade-offs apply here. |
| `--sample <N>` | off (check every segment) | Check only `N` segment(s) per file, spread evenly — same semantics as `download --stat`'s `--sample`. |
| `--pipeline-depth <N>` | `128` | How many `STAT` commands are pipelined per connection per round trip. Only affects `--method stat`; ignored for `head`/`body`, which don't pipeline (see `--stat` above for why). |
| `--fail-fast` | off | Stop scheduling work after the first article confirmed missing on every applicable server. Requests already pipelined are completed cleanly, and remaining articles are reported as skipped; use this when only a pass/fail verdict matters. |
| `--json` | off | Emit one JSON object per line (NDJSON) instead of the human-readable summary — see schema below. |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | off | Suppress the live progress bar and per-segment `missing`/`unreachable` lines; only the final summary (or, with `--json`, the JSON lines themselves) is printed. |
| `--server <NAME>` | every configured server | Use only the named `[[servers]]` entry (repeatable) — same as `download`'s `--server`. |
| `--independent-servers` | off | Check each configured server **on its own**, instead of combining them into one pass where later servers only get asked about segments earlier ones didn't have. Produces one result per server per `.nzb` — useful to compare providers' actual availability rather than a single failover-combined verdict. |

**Exit codes:** `0` — every article present on at least one server; `1` — at
least one article confirmed missing (some server returned a definitive
`430`/`423`/`420` and none had it); `2` — fatal error (bad config, unreadable
`.nzb`, no servers configured); `3` — inconclusive: no article was confirmed
missing, but at least one was unreachable (no configured server ever gave a
real answer for it). A confirmed miss always outranks "merely inconclusive"
when both occur in the same run, since it's the more actionable of the two.

#### Human-readable output (default)

```
checking 6968 segment(s) across 2 NZB(s) via STAT...

[1/2] release1.nzb
  complete: movie.mkv (200/200 segments)
  ...

summary
  articles present: 6968/6968 (100.0%)
  files complete:   24/24
  data used:        218.7 KiB (STAT only — no article data downloaded)
  elapsed:          1.3s (5360 articles/sec)
```

With `--independent-servers`, each server's summary is labeled
(`summary (news.example.com)`) and printed once per `.nzb` per server.

#### `--json` output

One JSON object **per line** (NDJSON, not a single array) — one line per
`.nzb`, or one line per `.nzb` per server when `--independent-servers` is
given:

```json
{
  "nzb": "release.name.nzb",
  "checked_at": "2026-08-11T18:04:22.910348Z",
  "method": "stat",
  "retries": 3,
  "servers": ["news.example.com", "backup.example.com"],
  "complete": true,
  "conclusive": true,
  "stopped_early": false,
  "total_articles": 6968,
  "present": 6968,
  "missing": 0,
  "missing_pct": 0.0,
  "unreachable": 0,
  "unreachable_pct": 0.0,
  "skipped": 0,
  "files": [
    { "name": "movie.mkv", "total_segments": 200, "present_segments": 200 }
  ],
  "missing_articles": [],
  "unreachable_articles": [],
  "bytes_used": 223948,
  "elapsed_secs": 1.301,
  "articles_per_second": 5355.9
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `nzb` | Basename of the `.nzb` file this line reports on. |
| `checked_at` | RFC3339 UTC timestamp taken when *this* outcome was resolved — not a single run-start stamp, since NZBs/servers can finish at different times. |
| `method` | The `--method` used for this check. |
| `retries` | Retry attempts per segment per server, from the config file's `retries`. |
| `servers` | Hostnames tried, in tier priority order. Only present in the combined (non-`--independent-servers`) case. |
| `server` | The single hostname this line's result came from. Only present with `--independent-servers`, in place of `servers`. |
| `complete` | `true` only if every segment was confirmed present — `false` for both confirmed-missing and merely-unreachable segments. |
| `conclusive` | `true` if every segment got a definitive present/absent answer from some server. **Check this before trusting `missing`/`missing_pct` as a final verdict** — if `false`, at least one segment's fate is unknown, and `missing` alone isn't enough to declare the release dead. |
| `stopped_early` | `true` when `--fail-fast` stopped after a confirmed missing article. A result with this field set is intentionally partial. |
| `total_articles` | Total segments listed in the `.nzb`, including any reported as `skipped` by a fail-fast run. |
| `present` | Segments confirmed present on at least one server. |
| `missing` / `missing_pct` | Segments at least one server definitively denied (`430`/`423`/`420`) and none confirmed present — the only case that should be treated as confirmed data loss. |
| `unreachable` / `unreachable_pct` | Segments no tried server ever gave a real answer for (connection failure, exhausted retries) — deliberately kept separate from `missing` so a transient network hiccup is never read as confirmed absence. |
| `skipped` | Segments not checked because `--fail-fast` had already found a confirmed missing article. They are neither missing nor unreachable. |
| `files` | Per-file breakdown, `.nzb` order: `name`, `total_segments`, `present_segments`. |
| `missing_articles` | `{ file_name, part, message_id }` for each confirmed-missing segment. |
| `unreachable_articles` | Same shape, for unreachable segments. |
| `sample_size` | Only present when `--sample <N>` was used — flags the result as partial coverage, not a full check. |
| `bytes_used` | Bytes actually sent/received over the wire to perform the check (e.g. every `STAT` command and response). |
| `elapsed_secs` | Wall-clock duration of the check (not including `.nzb` parsing). |
| `articles_per_second` | Throughput, based on `elapsed_secs`. |

### Progress

While fetching, `penne download` draws a live panel on stderr — an overall
progress bar, download speed, ETA, and one bar per file currently
downloading (capped so a release with many volumes doesn't flood the
terminal) — instead of sitting silent until the whole queue is done, which
would otherwise look like a hang on a large release. Redirected output
(not a terminal) falls back to one plain status line per whole percentage
point instead.

### Resume

An interrupted `penne download` run doesn't start over: every successfully
fetched article body is cached under `<out-dir>/.penne-cache/`, keyed by
Message-ID. Re-running the same command against the same `.nzb`/`--out-dir`
skips the network entirely for anything already cached. The cache is deleted
automatically once a run completes with nothing left incomplete or
damaged — at `--mode download`, that only happens if the fetch itself was
already fully clean; otherwise it's kept so a later `--mode repair` (or
higher) run can still use it.

### Encrypted releases (yEnc encryption)

Penne and Sugo support downloading releases encrypted with yEnc body and control-line
encryption (XChaCha20-Poly1305 and Radix 253 FF1) according to the v1.1 Self-Describing
Article Bootstrap Standard.

When an NZB includes `<meta type="yenc_encrypted">true</meta>`, decryption occurs
automatically using the password embedded in `<meta type="password">`. Penne extracts the
16-byte salt and unsigned 32-bit segment index directly from the 20-byte Line 1 bootstrap
prefix, validates dual-bootstrap cross-header agreement against `=yencryption`, and decodes
the article. Standard NZB 1.1 XML files without custom segment attributes are supported.

To supply or override the password manually:

```bash
cargo run --bin penne -- download path/to/encrypted.nzb --password MySecretPassword
```

Decryption operates on an article-by-article basis. Failed authentication releases
zero plaintext and triggers alternate-server failover before failing the job.

Encrypted releases are fully interoperable across all conforming ecosystem clients,
including Pesto, Nyuu, ngPost, Penne, Sugo, SABnzbd, and NZBGet.

- Content encryption at the article layer (XChaCha20-Poly1305) protects stored Usenet articles from unauthorized retrieval.
- Transport encryption (TLS) secures the network connection to the Usenet provider, while content encryption secures payload data at rest on servers.
- Because the encryption password is conventionally distributed within the NZB (`<meta type="password">`), confidentiality relies upon private distribution of the NZB file itself.

**Protocol Status:**
The yEnc encryption protocol is experimental. Canonical test vectors, key derivation parameters, and control-line formats are frozen for this release. An independent formal cryptographic review is recommended before stabilization.

## Roadmap

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). A web UI (à la SABnzbd) is planned as a
separate crate built on top of `penne` once the CLI/engine reach feature
parity with a real downloader — not before.
