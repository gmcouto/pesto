yEnc-encodes files, posts them over parallel NNTP connections, generates a `.nzb`,
and stays out of your way. Inspired by [`nyuu`](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu),
with a deliberately minimal scope: just the essentials, executed extremely fast.

## Installing

### Pre-built binary (recommended)

Download the latest binary for your platform from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/franzopl/pesto/releases) page:

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| Linux x86-64 (glibc) | `pesto-linux-x86_64` |
| Linux x86-64 (musl / Alpine) | `pesto-linux-x86_64-musl` |
| Windows x86-64 | `pesto-windows-x86_64.exe` |

Copy the binary to a directory on your `PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` on
Linux/macOS), marking it executable on Linux/macOS (`chmod +x`). On Windows,
rename it to `pesto.exe` and place it anywhere on your `PATH`.

### Install script (Windows / Linux)

For a one-command setup that also creates the hooks folder, run one of:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franzopl/pesto/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

```bash
# Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franzopl/pesto/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest binary, installs it to a per-user directory
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\pesto\bin` / `~/.local/bin`), adds that directory to your
`PATH`, creates the hooks folder (`%APPDATA%\pesto\hooks\` /
`~/.config/pesto/hooks/`), and runs the `--config` wizard if you don't have a
config yet. See [`scripts/install.ps1`](scripts/install.ps1) /
[`scripts/install.sh`](scripts/install.sh) for the `-HookUrl`/`--hook-url`
and `-ConfigUrl`/`--config-url` parameters distributors (e.g. an indexer
pointing its users at a pre-filled hook) can use to skip manual file editing
entirely. If the downloaded hook still contains the `YOUR_API_KEY`
placeholder (see [`examples/hooks/`](examples/hooks/)), the installer prompts
for it interactively and writes it into the hook file — pass
`-NoApiKeyPrompt`/`--no-api-key-prompt` to skip that.

### Via cargo

```bash
cargo install pesto-poster
```

The installed binary is named `pesto`.

### Docker (watch daemon)

Run `pesto --watch` as a container instead of a host service. The image is
**pesto CLI only** (not upapasta, penne, or sugo).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/franzopl/pesto:latest
docker run --rm ghcr.io/franzopl/pesto:latest --version
```

Each `pesto-v*` GitHub Release also publishes `ghcr.io/franzopl/pesto:<semver>`
and `:latest` (`linux/amd64`). The image binary is the same glibc artifact as
`pesto-linux-x86_64`. The first package may be private until a maintainer
marks it public (`docker login ghcr.io` until then).

Build from source:

```bash
docker build -t pesto .
docker run --rm pesto --version
```

Compose example (config / incoming / nzb / archive bind mounts, non-root,
`stop_grace_period: 30m`):

```bash
mkdir -p docker/config/pesto docker/incoming docker/nzb docker/archive
cp docker/config.toml.example docker/config/pesto/config.toml
# edit credentials — they are never baked into the image

docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up -d
```

The compose file uses `--nzb-dir /data/nzb`, not `--out` (`--out` is a file
path). `--compress=rar` is not in the image; 7z/zip are (`p7zip-full`).

**Signals.** SIGTERM tells `--watch` to stop polling. After 10 seconds pesto
aborts in-flight NNTP I/O and persists resume state — it does not keep
uploading a large release to completion. `stop_grace_period: 30m` only
prevents Docker's default 10s SIGKILL from racing that shutdown.

**Existing files.** `--watch` ignores entries already in the directory at
startup. After a restart, drain leftovers with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml --profile drain run --rm pesto-drain
```

or `pesto --each /data/incoming --cleanup-to /data/archive` (plus `--nzb-dir`).

[`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md).

### Build from source

---

## Build from source

Requires Rust **1.87 or newer** — install or update via <https://rustup.rs>.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary is written to `target/release/pesto`. Copy it anywhere on your `PATH`.

---

## Prerequisites

`pesto` itself has no mandatory runtime dependencies — the Rust binary is
self-contained. Some features require external tools:

| Feature | Tool required | Install |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `--compress` (7z / zip) | `p7zip` | `apt install p7zip-full` · `brew install p7zip` · [7-zip.org](https://www.7-zip.org) |
| `--compress=rar` | `rar` | [rarlab.com/download.htm](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) (not redistributable) |
| `--nfo` (video metadata) | `mediainfo` | `apt install mediainfo` · `brew install media-info` · [mediaarea.net](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) |

`pesto` will print a clear error if a required tool is missing. `mediainfo` is
optional and its absence degrades gracefully — `--nfo` falls back to a
directory listing instead.

Blu-ray disc analysis (`--nfo` on a BDMV folder) is handled in-process by
[`bdinfo-rs-core`](https://github.com/agentjp/bdinfo-rs) (LGPL-2.1), which is
compiled into the pesto binary. No external BDInfo tool is required.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create the config file (runs a short interactive wizard)
pesto --config

# 2. Post a file — that's it
pesto movie.mkv
```

The wizard writes `~/.config/pesto/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pesto/config.toml`).
`pesto` loads it automatically on every subsequent run, so you only need to configure
the server once. See [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml) for all available options.

---

## Configuration

### Config file

```toml
[server]
host        = "news.example.com"
port        = 563          # default; 119 for plaintext
ssl         = true         # default
connections = 10           # parallel NNTP connections

[auth]
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

[posting]
groups  = ["alt.binaries.test"]
par2    = 10               # % of PAR2 recovery data (0 = disabled)
# from omitted → random identity per run

[output]
nzb_dir = "/home/user/nzbs"   # where .nzb files are saved
```

Any config field can be overridden by a CLI flag for a single run.

### SOCKS5 proxy

Route every NNTP connection (including failover and verification connections) through SOCKS5 with `--proxy` / `-p`, or set `proxy = "socks5://host:port"` at the top level or under `[server]`. Bare `host:port` and `socks5h://` are accepted. The NNTP hostname is sent to the proxy for remote DNS resolution.

Before any article is posted, pesto validates the SOCKS5 connection, proxy authentication, and NNTP connection. The active proxy remains visible in a dedicated `proxy` panel throughout the upload. Add `--proxy-check-ip` to display the public exit IP through the proxy; this optional check contacts `api.ipify.org`.

```bash
ssh -D 1080 user@jump-host
pesto -p 127.0.0.1:1080 movie.mkv
# authenticated commercial proxy: --proxy socks5://user:pass@proxy.example:1080
```

### Multiple servers with automatic failover

```toml
[[servers]]
host        = "news.primary.com"
port        = 563
ssl         = true
connections = 20
username    = "user1"
password    = "pass1"

[[servers]]
host        = "news.fallback.com"
port        = 563
ssl         = true
connections = 10
username    = "user2"
password    = "pass2"
```

When `[[servers]]` is present, `[server]` and `[auth]` are ignored. Connections
that fail automatically retry on the next server in the list.

---

## Basic usage

### Post a single file

```bash
pesto movie.mkv
```

`pesto` loads the default config, opens 10 parallel TLS connections (or however
many you configured), and streams the file as yEnc-encoded articles. When done
it prints a summary and writes `movie.nzb` next to the binary (or in
`output.nzb_dir` if set in the config).

### Post a directory

```bash
pesto ./MyShow.S01/
```

The directory is walked recursively. Every file is posted as part of one logical
upload, with the folder structure preserved in the `.nzb` and PAR2 metadata so
a downloader can reconstruct the original layout. Files starting with `.` are
included; symbolic links are skipped. The `.nzb` is named after the root folder
(`MyShow.S01.nzb`).

#### DVD / Blu-ray full-disc backups

DVD and Blu-ray structures (e.g. `VIDEO_TS/`) often contain **0-byte
placeholder files** (e.g. `VTS_02_0.VOB`). Download clients identify obfuscated
files by their md5_16k hash and cannot match empty files — they will end up with
the obfuscated name in the wrong location.

pesto emits a warning when it detects 0-byte files in a release. The
recommended approach for full-disc backups is to use RAR compression, which
preserves the directory structure and is handled natively by all major download
clients:

```bash
pesto --compress=rar --obfuscate ./VIDEO_TS/
```

Without compression, the download is still correct and complete; only the
0-byte placeholder(s) need to be moved manually after download, or you can
use `par2 repair` to reconstruct the full layout from the flat download folder.

### Multiple files

```bash
pesto --out upload.nzb file1.mkv file2.mkv extras/bonus.mkv
```

All files are grouped into a single `.nzb`. The `--out` flag sets an explicit
output path; without it the name is derived from the first argument.

### Without a config file

All settings can be passed as flags:

```bash
pesto \
  --host news.example.com \
  --username alice --auth-password secret \
  --groups alt.binaries.test \
  --connections 20 \
  --out upload.nzb \
  movie.mkv
```

---

## Obfuscation

`--obfuscate` controls metadata visible on the wire; it does not encrypt
content or promise anonymity. The authoritative mode and artifact contracts
are documented in [docs/obfuscation.md](docs/obfuscation.md).

| Mode | Subject | yEnc `name=` | `From` header | Real path in `.nzb` |
|------|---------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| `none` (default) | real name | real name | config value | yes |
| `full` | random, 10–30 chars, independent per file | random, 10–30 chars, independent per file | random per file | yes |
| `full-shared` | one shared random prefix for the whole release | shared prefix + own random suffix per file | shared for the whole release | yes |
| `light` | one shared random prefix for the whole release | same string as Subject | shared for the whole release | wire Subject |
| `header-fragmented` | independent random name per article | opaque random name per physical file | random per article | yes |

`full` randomises everything on the wire using variable-length alphanumeric
strings (`[A-Za-z0-9]`, 10–30 characters) and a random sender address with a
random TLD. The real file names are only in the `.nzb` you keep, or recoverable
through the PAR2 set. `light` is the deliberate exception: its NZB repeats the
wire Subject so the same opaque token can be searched on public indexers.

Every mode above except `light` writes the canonical client path into the
`.nzb` it generates, regardless of what went out on the wire. `light` instead
mirrors its opaque wire Subject so the NZB supplies the same search token used
by public indexers. With `--compress`, that token also names the 7z/RAR archive
and its PAR2 FileDesc records; use a password to keep the archive's payload
names private. The other modes keep the client path in PAR2 File Description
packets so SABnzbd and NZBGet can perform their normal rename.

Pesto omits `Date:` by default in every mode and lets the server supply it.
Use `--date now` or an explicit timestamp only when required. The legacy
`--date random` behavior remains accepted with a deprecation warning; fake
dates are not a sound privacy boundary.

All modes use an opaque Message-ID local part containing 128 random bits and
no clock or counter. The domain is random per article unless
`--message-id-domain` is explicitly set.

A bare `--obfuscate` (no value) means `full`.

```bash
# Private default — names do not identify files, but content is not encrypted
pesto --obfuscate movie.mkv
# same as:
pesto --obfuscate=full movie.mkv

# Add archive encryption to protect content too
pesto --obfuscate --password movie.mkv
```

### Full-shared mode (for indexer compatibility)

`--obfuscate=full-shared` obfuscates filenames like `full` mode, but reuses a single
random *Subject* prefix (real extension, or archive volume suffix, kept) across the
entire release — all data files, PAR2 index, and recovery volumes. The yEnc body
`name=` also carries that same shared prefix, plus its own random suffix, so an
indexer reading only the yEnc body (not the Subject) can still recognise every
article as part of the release — but the random suffix keeps the Subject and yEnc
name from ever matching exactly (issue #106).
This preserves the ability for Usenet indexers to group files together, while still
keeping the release hidden from casual observation.

Use this when you want obfuscation but need indexer grouping (e.g. posting to
private trackers, or when your indexer has trouble with fully random names).

```bash
# Full obfuscation with shared name across all files (indexer-friendly)
pesto --obfuscate=full-shared movie.mkv

# With PAR2 and compression
pesto --obfuscate=full-shared --par2=5 --compress movie.mkv

# Typical use: multi-episode season with file numbering
pesto --obfuscate=full-shared --par2=5 --file-counter ./MyShow.S01/
```

### Light mode (exact Subject/yEnc name match)

`--obfuscate=light` is `full-shared` taken one step further: it shares the same
random prefix across the whole release, but the yEnc body `name=` is that shared
subject string *verbatim* — no independent random suffix. This was `full-shared`'s
own behavior before `v0.6.1`; that release added the random suffix to close an
exact-match fingerprint (Subject header == yEnc body name=) that identified posts
made by this tool. Some indexers key their own release grouping off that exact
match, though (reportedly including NZBIndex), so `light` restores it for anyone
who needs that over avoiding the fingerprint (issue #106).

`light`'s generated `.nzb` carries the same opaque Subject in its
`<file subject="...">` attribute. A recipient can use that one token to find
the posting in a public indexer; with a password-protected 7z or RAR upload,
the archive and PAR2 FileDesc use the same token while the real payload names
stay inside encrypted archive headers.

```bash
pesto --obfuscate=light movie.mkv

# Typical use: multi-episode season with file numbering
pesto --obfuscate=light --par2=5 --file-counter ./MyShow.S01/
```

| Mode | Wire names | Indexer grouping | Privacy |
|------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| `none` | Real filenames | ✓ Good | None |
| `full-shared` | Shared random name | ✓ Good | Moderate |
| `light` | Shared random name, Subject = yEnc name exactly | ✓ Good (strongest signal) | Moderate |
| `full` | Per-file random names | ✗ Poor | High |
| `header-fragmented` | Per-article headers, per-file opaque yEnc name | ✗ Header-only | High |

### Header-fragmented mode

`--obfuscate=header-fragmented` gives every article an independent Subject and
From header while retaining one opaque yEnc `name=` for every physical file.
That lets SABnzbd and NZBGet assemble and clean multipart data/PAR2 files, but
a body-aware observer can group a physical file's articles by its yEnc name.

```bash
pesto --obfuscate=header-fragmented movie.mkv
```

> **Legacy note:** `article` is hidden and experimental. It, and its
> `paranoid` alias, retain the old strict behavior where Subject, yEnc name and
> From all change per article. That mode is not compatible with conventional
> multipart PAR2 repair and cleanup.

### Choosing a mode

`--obfuscate` and `--password` protect two different things and don't affect
each other's behavior at all: `--obfuscate` controls what's visible on the
wire (Subject, yEnc `name=`, `From`) so header-scraping and search-by-title
can't identify the release; `--password` (see
[Compression and passwords](#compression-and-passwords) below) encrypts the
archive's actual content, so downloading the raw articles without your `.nzb`
doesn't get anyone a readable file. Combine them for both protections at
once — neither weakens the other, and `--password` behaves identically
regardless of which `--obfuscate` mode is active.

| Mode | Subject | yEnc `name=` | `From` | Real name in `.nzb` | Indexer grouping | Tool fingerprint avoided | + `--password` |
|------|---------|---------------|--------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| `none` | real name | real name | config value | yes (trivially) | yes, by real name | n/a — nothing hidden | archive content encrypted; release still searchable by real name |
| `full` | random, per file | random, per file (≠ Subject) | random, per file | yes | no — each file is its own unrelated identity | yes | archive content also encrypted; still only the `.nzb`/PAR2 recover it |
| `full-shared` | shared prefix, whole release | shared prefix + own random suffix (≠ Subject) | shared, whole release | yes | yes, by shared prefix | yes | same, plus content encrypted |
| `light` | shared prefix, whole release | **identical to Subject** | shared, whole release | yes | yes, strongest signal (exact Subject/yEnc match) | **no** — that exact match is the point | same, plus content encrypted |
| `header-fragmented` | random, per **article** | opaque random, per **physical file** | random, per article | yes | only to a body-aware observer, per file | yes | same, plus content encrypted; conventional client assembly still works |

Quick guidance:
- **Public, no privacy need** → `none`.
- **Maximum privacy, don't care about indexer grouping** → `full` (add
  `--password` to also hide the content from anyone who somehow gets the raw
  articles).
- **Want obfuscation but need an indexer to recognise/repair the release as
  one unit** → `full-shared` (the default recommendation) or `light` if your
  indexer specifically needs an exact Subject/yEnc `name=` match to group
  correctly (confirm empirically — `full-shared` is right for most).
- **Extra header fragmentation while keeping conventional client cleanup** →
  `header-fragmented`.

The hidden legacy `article` mode (and its `paranoid` alias) retains the stricter
per-article yEnc behavior for existing configurations. It has no conventional
multipart PAR2 repair/cleanup guarantee and is not a replacement for
`header-fragmented`.

---

## Compression and passwords

`--compress` bundles all input files into a single archive before encoding and
uploading. The archive is created in a temporary directory and deleted after posting.

### Supported formats

| Format | Flag | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| 7z (default) | `--compress` or `--compress=7z` | Store mode (no recompression); with password: encrypts headers too |
| ZIP | `--compress=zip` | Standard ZIP; password does not encrypt file names |
| RAR | `--compress=rar` | Requires `rar` binary in `PATH`; with password: header encryption |

### Open archive (no password)

```bash
# Default format (7z, store mode)
pesto --compress movie.mkv

# Explicit format
pesto --compress=zip movie.mkv
pesto --compress=rar movie.mkv
```

### Password-protected archive

```bash
# Random 24-character password — printed to stdout and embedded in the .nzb
pesto --password movie.mkv

# Explicit password
pesto --password=MySecret42 movie.mkv

# RAR with password (requires rar in PATH)
pesto --compress=rar --password=MySecret42 movie.mkv
```

When `--password` is used, the password is stored in `<meta type="password">`
inside the `.nzb` so that NZBGet and SABnzbd can extract automatically.

### Combined: obfuscation + password

```bash
# Full obfuscation and a random archive password
pesto --obfuscate --password movie.mkv

# Same, but explicit password and a directory input
pesto --obfuscate=full --password=MySecret42 ./MyShow.S01/
```

---

## Encryption (yEnc body & control lines)

Pesto supports opt-in yEnc body and control-line encryption according to the v1.1
Self-Describing Article Bootstrap Standard. Article bodies are encrypted with
XChaCha20-Poly1305 before yEnc encoding, and yEnc control lines (`=ybegin`, `=ypart`,
`=yend`, `=yencryption`) are encrypted using Radix 253 NIST SP 800-38G FF1.

Under the v1.1 bootstrap standard, each posted Usenet article is self-describing
and embeds its salt and monotonic segment index directly into the wire bytes:
- A 20-byte bootstrap prefix (`[16-byte raw salt][4-byte uint32_be(segmentIndex)]`)
  is prepended to physical Line 1 (`=ybegin`) before FF1 ciphertext.
- A canonical 5-token header line (`=yencryption cipher=XChaCha20-Poly1305 salt=<32_hex> index=<8_hex> tag=<32_hex>`)
  provides dual-bootstrap agreement for downloaders.

Generated NZBs strictly conform to the standard NZB 1.1 DTD without custom
XML attributes on `<segment>` elements, including only `<meta type="yenc_encrypted">true</meta>`
and `<meta type="password">` in `<head>`.

Encrypted releases are fully interoperable with all conforming downloaders across the
ecosystem, including Penne, Sugo, SABnzbd, and NZBGet.

### CLI usage

```bash
# Encrypt with a random 24-character password (printed to stdout and stored in .nzb)
pesto --encrypt movie.mkv

# Encrypt with an explicit password
pesto --encrypt=MySecret42 movie.mkv
# or
pesto --encrypt-password MySecret42 movie.mkv
```

### Configuration

Enable encryption or set a default password in `config.toml`:

```toml
[encryption]
password = "MySecretPassword"
```

### Threat Model

- **Confidentiality:** Content encryption at the article layer (XChaCha20-Poly1305) protects stored Usenet articles from parties without the NZB and password. However, because the encryption password is conventionally stored in the NZB (`<meta type="password">`), confidentiality depends strictly on private distribution of the generated `.nzb`.
- **Transport Security:** TLS continues to protect communication between the poster/downloader and NNTP servers, while content encryption protects payload data at rest on Usenet backend storage.
- **Integrity & Authenticity:** Poly1305 tags authenticate segment bodies; tampering or truncation causes fail-closed authentication errors releasing zero unauthenticated plaintext.

### Unsupported Operations

- **Season Consolidation (`--season`):** Multi-session / season pack consolidation into a single combined NZB is currently **not supported** for encrypted releases. Each episode upload generates an independent random session salt and a separate global segment index space starting at 1. Combining multiple independent upload sessions into a single `.nzb` violates global segment index uniqueness and causes duplicate indices. Individual per-episode NZBs are generated instead.
- **Archive Passwords vs Transport Encryption:** An archive password passed to `--password` encrypts the archive file itself. It is distinct from `--encrypt`, which activates yEnc body and control-line transport encryption. Conforming downloaders inspect `<meta type="yenc_encrypted">true</meta>` to distinguish transport encryption from archive extraction passwords.

### Protocol Status

The yEnc encryption protocol is explicitly **experimental**. The key derivation (Argon2id), nonce/tweak rules, FF1 control-line format, and canonical test vectors are frozen for this release. An independent formal cryptographic review is recommended prior to stabilizing the specification across the ecosystem.

---

## PAR2 recovery data

pesto generates PAR2 parity files using its own pure-Rust implementation.
Parity is computed in the same single read pass as posting, so it adds minimal
overhead. The PAR2 files are uploaded alongside the data and referenced in the `.nzb`.

`none`, `light`, and `full-shared` post the conventional standalone index and
recovery volumes. `full` and `article` post recovery volumes only; every volume
contains Main + FileDesc + IFSC metadata and is usable by standard PAR2 tools
without the separate index. The real relative path remains visible to anyone
who downloads a volume. No size-obscuring padding is added.

```bash
# 10% recovery data (default when par2 is set in config)
pesto movie.mkv

# Explicit percentage
pesto --par2 15 movie.mkv

# Disable PAR2 for this run
pesto --par2 0 movie.mkv

# Generate PAR2 files next to the source without posting
pesto --par2-only movie.mkv
pesto --par2-only ./MyShow.S01/

# Generate all PAR2 recovery data before posting anything, instead of
# concurrently with the upload (the default) — posts the data files then
# the already-generated PAR2 index/volumes back to back, no gap between
# them. Useful on a memory-constrained host, where a large release's PAR2
# generation can need multiple passes and end up posted a while after its
# data files, which some indexers fail to group as one release.
pesto --par2-before-upload movie.mkv
```

### PAR2 scratch directory

During a normal posting run, `--par2-temp-dir <DIR>` (or
`posting.par2_temp_dir` in the configuration file) selects the base directory
for intermediate PAR2 files. Pesto creates a unique
`parmesan_<pid>_<run_id>` directory underneath it, writes the PAR2 index and
recovery volumes there, reads those files back for posting/checks/retries, and
then removes the per-run directory. The configured base directory is retained.

PAR2 recovery is computed in RAM before these files are materialised, so the
directory does not exist during most of the PAR2 computation and may be
short-lived on a fast system. Run with `-v` to see the effective path, written
file count and byte count, and cleanup result. `--par2-only` does not use this
scratch directory; it writes PAR2 files next to the sources.

### SIMD acceleration

pesto selects the fastest available Reed-Solomon path at startup via runtime
CPU feature detection:

### yEnc encoding performance

pesto features a world-class yEnc encoder utilizing SIMD expansion tables
(`PSHUFB`) and direct pointer manipulation. It is designed to saturate the
memory bandwidth of modern CPUs.

Measured throughput on an Intel i5-10400 (line length 128):

> **Benchmark context:** this historical result does not record a performance-governor run. CPU governor and boost settings affect absolute throughput.

| Tool | yEnc throughput |

| **pesto** (v0.2.23) | **2 204 MB/s** |
| `nyuu` / `node-yencode` | 2 165 MB/s |

**Benchmarking vs node-yencode**:

## Batch and watch modes

### `--each` — post each entry as a separate upload

```bash
# Post each top-level item in a directory as its own release with its own .nzb
pesto --each ./Season01/

# Run up to 4 uploads in parallel
pesto --each --jobs 4 ./Season01/
```

### `--season` — batch with a combined season NZB

```bash
# Post each episode independently AND produce one consolidated Season01.nzb
pesto --season ./Season01/

# Parallel posting, 2 jobs at a time
pesto --season --jobs 2 ./Season01/
```

The combined season NZB is written only when every episode is complete and
the batch was not cancelled. `--allow-incomplete-nzb` can permit an individual
episode NZB with confirmed-missing articles, but it never permits a partial
combined season NZB. POST failures and inconclusive checks also block the
combined NZB in both the CLI and UpaPasta.

### `--watch` — daemon mode

```bash
# Watch a folder and post every new entry automatically (Ctrl-C / SIGTERM to stop)
pesto --watch ./incoming/

# Post up to 3 entries in parallel with a 60-second poll interval
pesto --watch ./incoming/ --jobs 3 --watch-interval 60
```

Entries already present in the watched directory when `pesto` starts are ignored;
only new arrivals are posted. By default, completed entries are left in place.
To run `--watch` as a container, see [Docker (watch daemon)](#docker-watch-daemon).

### `--cleanup` and `--cleanup-to` — source cleanup after upload

After a successful upload (with no failures or cancellation), automatically clean up the source files/directories:

```bash
# Delete sources after upload
pesto --cleanup movie.mkv
pesto --watch ./incoming/ --cleanup

# Move sources to an archive directory after upload (safer than delete)
pesto --cleanup-to ./archive/ movie.mkv
pesto --each ./Season01/ --cleanup-to ./uploaded/
pesto --watch ./incoming/ --cleanup-to ./archive/
```

Both flags work with any upload mode (`--watch`, `--each`, `--season`, or direct uploads).
Use `--cleanup-to` for a non-destructive approach: sources remain accessible in the archive
directory if you need to verify or re-post them. The `--cleanup` and `--cleanup-to` flags
are mutually exclusive.

### `--ext` — restrict uploads to specific extensions

```bash
# Only post .mkv files: a subtitle sitting loose next to the video no longer
# becomes its own release under --each/--watch, and a nested .srt is dropped
# from an episode's upload instead of being bundled in
pesto --each --ext mkv ./Season01/
pesto --watch ./incoming/ --each --ext mkv

# Comma-separate to allow more than one extension
pesto --each --ext mkv,mp4 ./Season01/
```

`--ext` is a no-op by default (every file is included). It's most useful with
`--each`/`--season`/`--watch`, where a downloaded release folder often mixes
the video with subtitles, samples, or other extras you don't want posted as
their own release or bundled into one.

---

## Reliability

### Upload resume

If a posting run is interrupted (Ctrl-C, network failure, articles still
missing after every automatic retry, etc.), `pesto` can pick up where it left
off instead of re-posting everything from scratch.

Progress is tracked automatically for every run. If a run ends incomplete, that
progress is saved to a `.pesto-state` sidecar file next to the `.nzb`; if it
completes successfully, any state file is deleted — there is nothing left to
resume from a finished upload. `--resume` controls the other half: whether a
*prior* run's saved state is actually loaded and its already-posted segments
skipped. Without it, `pesto` always starts fresh, even if a `.pesto-state` file
is sitting right there.

Resume state also records whether each segment was confirmed and whether
checking was disabled. A confirmed segment is skipped. With `--no-check`, a
segment saved by a no-check run is also skipped. In every other case —
including state written by older pesto versions before these fields existed —
`--resume --check` first sends `STAT` for the saved `Message-ID`: `223` skips
the segment, `430` posts it again, and an inconclusive reply leaves it
unverified without posting a duplicate.

```bash
pesto --resume movie.mkv
```

Or enable it permanently in config.toml:
```toml
[output]
resume = true
```

When posting finishes but only a handful of articles fail the post-check,
`pesto` already retries them automatically in the same run before giving up
(see `--check-post-retries` and `--check-recover-max` below) — `--resume` is
for what that can't cover: a run interrupted outright, or one where too many
articles failed to justify an automatic retry. When a run does end that way,
the printed error includes a ready-to-run retry command with the original
`--article-size`/`--obfuscate`/`--par2`/`--compress` values already filled in.

**Safety.** A saved state is only trusted if it was recorded under the same
posting parameters (`--article-size`, `--obfuscate`, `--compress`, `--par2`)
and, per file, the same size and modification time as what `--resume` sees
now. Any mismatch — different parameters, or a file that changed since the
state was recorded — is discarded rather than partially trusted, so a
mismatched retry never corrupts the `.nzb`; it just re-posts as if `--resume`
had not found anything.

**Compressed uploads (`--compress`).** The archive is rebuilt from scratch on
every run, so it always looks "changed" to the per-file check above and its
segments can't be skipped on `--resume` — the archive's *content* is not
resumable today. What does carry over: the obfuscated name/identity used to
build it (reused instead of regenerated, so at least the file doesn't change
identity every retry), and any article that was sent but never got a
confirmed response (see below). The same applies to PAR2 recovery volumes for
segments an interrupted run never reached — they're regenerated, not resumed.
A plain, uncompressed upload gets full data-level resume; a compressed one
mainly gets a safe, fast "no" instead of a slow re-post pretending to be a
skip.

**Sent but unconfirmed.** A segment whose article was sent but whose server
acknowledgement never arrived (e.g. the connection dropped between `POST` and
reading `240`) is cached in a `.pesto-spool` sidecar directory as soon as it's
encoded, before it goes over the wire. On `--resume`, that exact article is
replayed under its original `Message-ID` instead of being re-encoded and
posted under a new one — avoiding a duplicate article if the original `POST`
had, in fact, gone through.

### Per-upload logs

Every upload writes a DEBUG-level log to `<history_dir>/logs/` (default
`~/.config/pesto/logs/`), named `<timestamp>_<name>.log`. This happens
regardless of `-v`, so you can analyse any run afterwards — including which
articles a server rejected and why (e.g. `441 437 ... TooOld`, `441 435`
duplicate) — without having to reproduce it with `-vv`. Only the 50 most recent
pesto logs are kept; older ones are pruned automatically. Files that don't match
pesto's naming (e.g. legacy upapasta logs sharing the same directory) are never
touched.

Note that the `-v` flag and these logs are independent: `-v` controls what is
printed to your terminal (stderr), while the saved log is always full DEBUG.
Redirecting the terminal with `> file` captures **stdout only**, which is why a
plain `pesto ... > log.txt` saves almost nothing — use the saved session log,
`--log-file`, or `2>` instead.

Disable the saved log per-run with `--no-session-log`, or permanently:
```toml
[output]
session_log = false
```

### Post-verification via STAT (`--check`)

pesto verifies every posted article with a streaming `STAT` check, **on by
default**. Each article that gets a clean `240` from its `POST` is queued for
a `STAT` confirmation `--check-delay` seconds later (default **5**), using a
small pool of connections dedicated to checking — carved out of
`--connections`, not opened on top of it, so the total connection count never
changes. This runs concurrently with the upload rather than as a separate
pass afterward, so by the time the last file finishes posting most of the
run's articles are typically already confirmed.

The connection budget is strict. With `--connections N`, at least one slot is
kept for posting and the check pool is capped at `N - 1`; for example,
`--connections 10 --check-connections 10` runs with 9 check connections and
1 posting connection. Checking therefore requires at least two total
connections. Reposts and the final recovery pass reuse slots already held by
the check pool and never open sockets beyond `--connections`.

A miss is retried up to `--check-retries` times (default **3**, **20 s**
apart). If it's still missing, pesto reposts it under a fresh `Message-ID`
(so the `.nzb` stays valid) and queues the new copy for another round of
checks. `--check-post-retries` (default **1**) caps how many times a single
article can be reposted before it's given up on as permanently missing.

Each check ends in one of three states: `223` is confirmed present; `430`
after all retry and recovery rounds is confirmed missing; and a timeout,
connection failure, authentication failure, or other unexpected server reply
is **inconclusive**. An inconclusive check is not evidence that the article is
missing, so pesto does not repost it as a confirmed miss. It blocks the NZB,
post-upload hooks, cleanup, and a successful exit so that `--resume --check`
can retry `STAT` for the same `Message-ID` without another `POST`.

`--allow-incomplete-nzb` applies only to articles confirmed missing by `430`.
It may publish that incomplete per-upload NZB and runs its hooks with
`PESTO_INCOMPLETE=1`; it never overrides a POST failure or an inconclusive
check.

Disable the whole thing with `--no-check` if you'd rather skip verification
entirely — faster, but you won't find out about missing articles until
something tries to download the release.

```bash
# Default: the streaming check runs automatically
pesto movie.mkv

# Disable it
pesto --no-check movie.mkv

# Wait longer before the first STAT attempt (servers with slow propagation)
pesto --check-delay 60 movie.mkv

# More patience per article: 5 attempts, 20 s apart
pesto --check-retries 5 movie.mkv

# Cap the dedicated check pool at 8 connections
pesto --check-connections 8 movie.mkv
```

The terminal shows check progress as a trailing band on the upload bar, plus
a live tally of verified/pending/missing/reposted articles in its own box:

```
┌─ upload ────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [████████████████░░░░░░░░] 68%  2912/4281 seg    │
│ 1.9 GiB/2.8 GiB · 42 MiB/s                        │
│ ETA 0:21                                          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─ check ─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2601 verified · 311 pending                       │
│ elapsed 0:14                                      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When articles are missing or get reposted, the check box's first line switches
to `<verified> · <pending> · N missing` and appends `· N reposted`.

| Flag | Config key | Default | Description |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--check` / `--no-check` | `posting.check` | **on** | Run the streaming STAT check; `--no-check` disables it |
| `--check-delay <SECS>` | `posting.check_delay` | `5` | Seconds to wait after an article posts before its first STAT check |
| `--check-retries <N>` | `posting.check_retries` | `3` | STAT attempts per posted copy; 20 s between each |
| `--check-connections <N>` | `posting.check_connections` | auto (~8% of total, capped at 4) | Dedicated connections for the check queue, carved out of `--connections` |
| `--check-post-retries <N>` | `posting.check_post_retries` | `1` | Repost attempts per article once its STAT retries are exhausted |
| `--allow-incomplete-nzb` | `posting.allow_incomplete_nzb` | off | Write the `.nzb` anyway if articles are still confirmed missing after `--check-post-retries` |
| `--check-recover-percent <N>` | `posting.check_recover_percent` | `15` | Skip the automatic final recovery pass below if still-missing articles exceed this percent of the release |
| `--check-recover-max <N>` | `posting.check_recover_max` | `50` | After `--check-post-retries` is exhausted, automatically retry once more if at most this many articles (and within `--check-recover-percent`) are still missing; `0` disables |

### Rate limiting

```bash
# Limit total upload speed to 50 MiB/s across all connections
pesto --rate "50 MiB/s" movie.mkv

# Accepted units: B, KB/KiB, MB/MiB, GB/GiB (all case-insensitive)
pesto --rate "10 MB/s" movie.mkv
```

### Dry run

```bash
# Encode everything and measure performance — never touch the network
pesto --dry-run movie.mkv
pesto --dry-run --par2 15 ./MyShow.S01/
```

---

## NZB metadata

### Custom NZB metadata

```bash
# Set the display name shown in NZBGet / SABnzbd
pesto --nzb-title "My Movie (2024)" movie.mkv

# Set a category and extraction password
pesto --nzb-category "Movies" --nzb-password "archive_pass" movie.mkv

# Add multiple tags (repeat --nzb-tag for each one)
pesto --nzb-tag hd --nzb-tag 2024 --nzb-tag dts movie.mkv
```

These values are written as `<meta>` elements in the `.nzb`:

```xml
<meta type="title">My Movie (2024)</meta>
<meta type="category">Movies</meta>
<meta type="password">archive_pass</meta>
<meta type="tag">hd</meta>
<meta type="tag">2024</meta>
<meta type="tag">dts</meta>
```

`--nzb-title` maps to `<meta type="title">` — SABnzbd's documented meta type for a
human-readable NZB name; plain `<meta type="name">` isn't part of the NZB 1.1 spec.
`--nzb-name` is a deprecated alias, still accepted with a warning.

`--nzb-tag` can be repeated; each occurrence produces one `<meta type="tag">`.
If `--nzb-tag` is used on the command line, it replaces any `nzb_tags` set in
`config.toml`. When `--obfuscate` is active, pesto also adds its own
`<meta type="tag">obfuscated:<mode></meta>` (e.g. `obfuscated:full`) automatically,
so an indexer can tell an obfuscated release apart from a plain one without
inspecting article headers.

### NZB output path

By default the `.nzb` (and `.nfo` when `--nfo` is enabled) are saved in the
current working directory, named after the uploaded file or folder.

Use `--nzb-dir` or `output.nzb_dir` to redirect all output files to a fixed
directory. `~` is expanded to the home directory.

```bash
# Explicit path for a single run
pesto --out /nzbs/movie.nzb movie.mkv

# Fixed output directory via flag
pesto --nzb-dir ~/nzb/pesto movie.mkv

# Fixed output directory via config (recommended)
# ~/.config/pesto/config.toml
# [output]
# nzb_dir = "~/nzb/pesto"
# nfo     = true
```

With the config above, `pesto arquivo.mkv` saves `~/nzb/pesto/arquivo.nzb`
and `~/nzb/pesto/arquivo.nfo` on every run without any extra flags.

---

## Hooks

pesto supports two hook points: **pre-upload** (runs before anything is posted,
can abort the upload) and **post-upload** (runs after a successful upload).

`--no-hooks` disables only the executable scripts found in `~/.config/pesto/hooks/`;
explicit `--pre-hook` and `--post-hook` commands are unaffected. This lets you
run a single explicit hook without triggering every directory script.

To make this the permanent default instead of passing `--no-hooks` on every
run, set it once in `config.toml`:

```toml
[output]
no_hooks = true
```

### Pre-upload hook

A pre-upload hook runs **before compression, PAR2 generation, and NNTP
connection**. If the command exits with a non-zero code the upload is aborted
immediately — nothing is posted and no state is written.

**Use case:** query NZBHydra2 or Prowlarr to check for duplicates before
uploading.

There are two ways to register a pre-upload hook:

- **`config.toml`** — runs for every upload:
  ```toml
  [output]
  pre_hook = "~/.config/pesto/hooks/check-duplicate.sh"
  ```
- **`~/.config/pesto/pre-hooks/` directory** — every executable in this
  directory is run in alphabetical order before the upload:
  ```bash
  chmod +x ~/.config/pesto/pre-hooks/check-duplicate.sh
  ```
- **`--pre-hook <CMD>`** — one-off command for a single run:
  ```bash
  pesto --pre-hook '~/.config/pesto/hooks/check-duplicate.sh' movie.mkv
  ```

`--no-hooks` suppresses the `pre-hooks/` directory scripts. The `--pre-hook`
flag and `output.pre_hook` config value are **not** affected — they always run.
Pre-hooks are never run during `--dry-run`.

Environment variables available to the pre-hook:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PESTO_NAME` | Release name / entry label |
| `PESTO_BYTES` | Total size in bytes of all input files (decimal string) |
| `PESTO_INPUT_PATHS` | Colon-separated list of input file/directory paths |
| `PESTO_SERVER` | NNTP server hostname |
| `PESTO_GROUP` | First configured newsgroup |
| `PESTO_GROUPS` | Colon-separated list of all configured newsgroups |
| `PESTO_CATEGORY` | Value of `--nzb-category` (empty when not set) |
| `PESTO_NZB_TITLE` | Value of `--nzb-title` (empty when not set) |
| `PESTO_NZB_NAME` | Deprecated alias of `PESTO_NZB_TITLE`, same value |
| `PESTO_OBFUSCATE` | Obfuscation mode in use: `none`, `light`, `full-shared`, `full`, `header-fragmented`, or legacy `article` |
| `PESTO_PAR2` | PAR2 redundancy percentage (e.g. `10`) |
| `PESTO_TAGS` | Space-separated list of NZB tags (empty when none) |

> `PESTO_NZB`, `PESTO_NFO`, and `PESTO_PASSWORD` are **not** available in the
> pre-hook — the NZB and NFO don't exist yet, and the archive password is only
> resolved after compression.

### Post-upload hooks

Any executable script placed in `~/.config/pesto/hooks/` is run automatically
after each successful upload, in alphabetical order. Each script receives the
following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PESTO_NZB` | Absolute path to the generated `.nzb` file |
| `PESTO_NFO` | Absolute path to the `.nfo` file (empty when `--nfo` was not used) |
| `PESTO_NAME` | Release name / entry label |
| `PESTO_BYTES` | Total bytes posted (decimal string) |
| `PESTO_INPUT_PATHS` | Colon-separated list of input file/directory paths |
| `PESTO_SERVER` | NNTP server hostname |
| `PESTO_GROUP` | First Usenet newsgroup |
| `PESTO_GROUPS` | Colon-separated list of all configured newsgroups |
| `PESTO_PASSWORD` | Archive password (empty when none) |
| `PESTO_CATEGORY` | Value of `--nzb-category` (empty when not set) |
| `PESTO_NZB_TITLE` | Value of `--nzb-title` (empty when not set) |
| `PESTO_NZB_NAME` | Deprecated alias of `PESTO_NZB_TITLE`, same value |
| `PESTO_OBFUSCATE` | Obfuscation mode in use: `none`, `light`, `full-shared`, `full`, `header-fragmented`, or legacy `article` |
| `PESTO_PAR2` | PAR2 redundancy percentage (e.g. `10`) |
| `PESTO_TAGS` | Space-separated list of NZB tags (empty when none) |
| `PESTO_WIRE_SUBJECT` | The actual `Subject:` header sent to the NNTP server for the first posted file — differs from the real filename under `--obfuscate` (empty when nothing was posted) |

Scripts must have the executable bit set on Unix (`chmod +x`). On Windows,
files with `.exe`, `.cmd`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, or `.py` extensions are recognised
automatically.

A hook that exits non-zero is logged and skipped; the remaining hooks still
run. Hooks are suppressed for `--par2-only`, `--dry-run`, and failed uploads.

You can also run a one-off command for a single invocation with `--post-hook`:

```bash
pesto --post-hook 'notify-send "pesto" "Upload done: $PESTO_NAME"' movie.mkv
```

### NFO generation

Pass `--nfo` to generate a `.nfo` text file alongside the `.nzb`. pesto runs
`mediainfo` on the first video file it finds; for generic folders it falls back
to a recursive directory listing. The path is exposed as `PESTO_NFO` to every
hook script.

For Blu-ray disc structures (`BDMV/` layout), pesto uses
[`bdinfo-rs-core`](https://github.com/agentjp/bdinfo-rs) — a memory-safe,
pure-Rust Blu-ray analyzer compiled directly into the binary. No external tool
is needed. It handles playlist selection, stream analysis, and QUICK SUMMARY
generation in-process. The mediainfo fallback path is kept for the rare case
where the in-process scan fails on a severely damaged disc structure.

NFO generation is a local operation — it works with `--dry-run` just as it
does in a full upload run.

```bash
pesto --nfo movie.mkv
pesto --dry-run --nfo movie.mkv   # generate NFO without touching the network
```

### Bundled examples

The [`examples/hooks/`](examples/hooks/) directory contains ready-to-use hook
scripts:

| Script | Platform | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| [`print-vars.sh`](examples/hooks/print-vars.sh) | Unix | Prints all `PESTO_*` variables — useful as a starting point or for debugging |
| [`generic-indexer.sh`](examples/hooks/generic-indexer.sh) | Unix | Sends the NZB (and optional NFO) to any Newznab-compatible indexer via its REST API |
| [`generic-indexer.bat`](examples/hooks/generic-indexer.bat) | Windows | Same as above — `.bat` version for `cmd.exe` |
| [`generic-indexer.ps1`](examples/hooks/generic-indexer.ps1) | Windows | Same as above — PowerShell version with native JSON parsing (recommended on Windows) |
| [`different-indexer.sh`](examples/hooks/different-indexer.sh) | Unix | Sends the NZB (and optional NFO) to an indexer that takes the API key as a query parameter and replies with a JSON `guid` |
| [`different-indexer.ps1`](examples/hooks/different-indexer.ps1) | Windows | Same as above — PowerShell version |

To install a hook on Unix:

```bash
cp examples/hooks/generic-indexer.sh ~/.config/pesto/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.config/pesto/hooks/generic-indexer.sh
# edit API_KEY and INDEXER_URL inside the file
```

To install a hook on Windows, copy the `.bat` or `.ps1` file to `%APPDATA%\pesto\hooks\` and edit the variables at the top of the file. For the PowerShell version, set `post_hook` in `config.toml`:

```toml
post_hook = "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"%APPDATA%\\pesto\\hooks\\generic-indexer.ps1\""
```

`.ps1` scripts run via `pwsh` (PowerShell 7+) when it is on `PATH`, falling back
to the built-in `powershell` (Windows PowerShell 5.1) otherwise. If you write
your own `.ps1` hooks using syntax that only exists in PowerShell 6+, install
[PowerShell 7](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases) to have it
picked up automatically — no config change needed.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | All segments posted successfully |
| `1` | One or more segments failed |
| `130` | Interrupted by Ctrl-C |

On Ctrl-C, `pesto` stops queuing new segments, lets in-flight ones finish, and
still writes a `.nzb` for everything that was posted.

---

## JSON output mode

`--output-format json` switches from the interactive terminal panel to
newline-delimited JSON events on stdout. Intended for scripting and integration
with tools like `upapasta`.

```bash
pesto --output-format json movie.mkv
```

All diagnostic messages go to stderr; stdout carries only the event stream, so
it is safe to pipe or redirect without filtering.

### Event reference

Every event is a JSON object on a single line. The `type` field identifies it.

#### `started`

Emitted once at the beginning of the run.

```json
{"type":"started","total_files":2,"total_bytes":4294967296,"total_segments":5590,"connections":10,"target":"news.example.com:563"}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `total_files` | integer | Number of input files (including PAR2 estimate) |
| `total_bytes` | integer | Sum of raw input bytes |
| `total_segments` | integer | Total number of yEnc segments to post |
| `connections` | integer | Number of NNTP worker connections |
| `target` | string \| null | `host:port` of the NNTP server; `null` for `--par2-only` |

#### `segment_done`

Emitted after each segment is posted (or skipped via resume).

```json
{"type":"segment_done","file":"movie.mkv","bytes":768000,"ok":true,"done_segments":1,"total_segments":5590,"done_bytes":768000,"total_bytes":4294967296,"progress_pct":0.0}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `file` | string | Relative path of the file this segment belongs to |
| `bytes` | integer | Raw payload size of this segment in bytes |
| `ok` | boolean | `false` if the segment failed every retry |
| `done_segments` | integer | Running total of completed segments |
| `total_segments` | integer | Total segments in the run |
| `done_bytes` | integer | Running total of completed bytes |
| `total_bytes` | integer | Total bytes in the run |
| `progress_pct` | float | Overall completion percentage (0–100) |

#### `queue_extended`

Emitted when PAR2 files are appended to the work queue (after the data pass
computes parity). Updates `total_segments` and `total_bytes` upwards.

```json
{"type":"queue_extended","file":"movie.mkv.vol0+1.par2","segments":12,"bytes":9216000,"total_segments":5602,"total_bytes":4303183296}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `file` | string | PAR2 file being added |
| `segments` | integer | Segments added for this file |
| `bytes` | integer | Bytes added for this file |
| `total_segments` | integer | Updated total segments |
| `total_bytes` | integer | Updated total bytes |

#### `status`

A short human-readable note from the poster (e.g. "computing PAR2"). An empty
string clears the current status.

```json
{"type":"status","text":"computing PAR2 recovery data"}
```

#### `failed`

A segment failed permanently after exhausting all retries.

```json
{"type":"failed","description":"segment 42 of movie.mkv: 441 Posting not allowed"}
```

#### `interrupted`

Emitted when Ctrl-C is received. The run is winding down; a `finished` event
follows once in-flight segments complete.

```json
{"type":"interrupted"}
```

#### `compress_started`

Archive creation has begun.

```json
{"type":"compress_started","total_bytes":4294967296}
```

#### `compress_progress`

Archive file on disk has grown (polled approximately every 200 ms).

```json
{"type":"compress_progress","bytes_written":134217728}
```

#### `compress_done`

Archive is complete and ready for posting.

```json
{"type":"compress_done"}
```

#### `par2_write_started`

PAR2 recovery volume writing has started.

```json
{"type":"par2_write_started","total":64}
```

`total` is the number of PAR2 recovery slices that will be written.

#### `par2_slice_written`

One PAR2 recovery slice has been written to disk. Emitted `total` times after
`par2_write_started`.

```json
{"type":"par2_slice_written"}
```

#### `finished`

Always the last event. The run is complete.

```json
{"type":"finished","segments":5590,"failures":0,"progress_pct":100.0,"ok":true}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `segments` | integer | Total segments processed |
| `failures` | integer | Segments that failed permanently |
| `progress_pct` | float | Final completion percentage |
| `ok` | boolean | `true` if all segments succeeded |

#### `nzb_written`

Printed by `pesto` after `finished`, once the `.nzb` file has been written to
disk. Not part of the internal event stream — always the very last line.

```json
{"type":"nzb_written","path":"/home/user/nzbs/movie.nzb"}
```

## Performance

The release benchmark uses real seeded corpora and a local mock NNTP server.
Figures are medians; see [`bench/README.md`](bench/README.md) for the complete
methodology, RSD, hardware fingerprints, raw data, and limitations.

### Post-only and end-to-end

Medialab i5-10400 (6 physical cores, AVX2), governor `performance`, three
repetitions, eight connections. Nyuu 0.4.2 and ParPar 0.4.5.

| workload | scenario | pesto | competitor | result |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| movie-1080p | post-only, 0 ms | **2226.1 MiB/s** | Nyuu 1339.4 MiB/s | **1.66x** |
| movie-1080p | post-only, 30 ms | **92.2 MiB/s** | Nyuu 92.0 MiB/s | **1.00x** |
| movie-1080p | full two-phase, 0 ms | 265.5 MiB/s | ParPar+Nyuu 283.4 MiB/s | 6.3% gap |
| movie-1080p | full streaming, 30 ms | **82.8 MiB/s** | ParPar+Nyuu two-phase 68.2 MiB/s | **1.21x** |
| many-small | post-only, 0 ms | **1760.6 MiB/s** | Nyuu 505.6 MiB/s | **3.48x** |
| many-small | full two-phase, 0 ms | **244.0 MiB/s** | ParPar+Nyuu 161.3 MiB/s | **1.51x** |

At 30 ms, the post-only rows are latency-limited and Pesto/Nyuu converge as
expected. Pesto's default streaming pipeline can overlap PAR2 creation with
posting; the like-for-like competitor row is `--par2-before-upload`.

### PAR2 create

AWS c7i.2xlarge (4 physical cores, AVX-512+GFNI), five measured repetitions
after one excluded warmup, 200 recovery blocks and a 1 GiB memory limit.
ParPar 0.4.6.

| workload | Parmesan | ParPar | result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| movie-1080p | **553.2 MiB/s** | 577.8 MiB/s | 4.3% gap |
| many-small | **464.3 MiB/s** | 234.9 MiB/s | **1.98x** |

The 4.3% movie gap is practical parity. All nine official cross-tool checks
passed, including byte-exact Parmesan↔par2cmdline repair and independent yEnc
wire reconstruction.

### Reproduce on your machine

```bash
cargo build --release
./bench/run.sh --list    # what would run, and which competitors are installed
./bench/run.sh micro     # yEnc + PAR2 microbenchmarks (no test corpus needed)
./bench/run.sh           # everything: micro, pipeline stages, full uploads
```

No Usenet account is needed. Test corpora are generated from fixed seeds, so
the input bytes are identical on any machine, and all posting runs go to a
local mock NNTP server — which also means the end-to-end numbers can be taken
with a simulated round-trip time (`--latencies 0,30`) instead of whatever the
network was doing that afternoon.

Each run writes `report.md` (tables), `summary.csv`, `raw.csv` and
`results.json` under `bench/results/<host>/<timestamp>/`, alongside a
`system.json` recording the CPU, SIMD tier, core count and every tool version.

The exact release-validation command and committed artifacts are in
[`bench/README.md`](bench/README.md).
